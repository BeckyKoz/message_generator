# message_generator
## Codecademy project to create random messages using JavaScript, Node, and git

This is an open-ended project from Codecademy with general instructions to create a JavaScript-based random message generator. You will need Node to run it. An additional component of the project is to practice using source control through Github. 

### Ideas:

        - Today is a good day to:
        - Your spirit animal today is: 
        - Your mantra today should be: 

- **"What Should I Draw?" generator**  
    - Animal(s)
    - With a blank
    - Doing an action
    - At a location

### Construction
- Store components in arrays in JavaScript
- Use random numbers to assemble into a message
- Print onto the console using Node.js

### Timeline, Goals, Scope Creep
- One week to completion (Friday, 7 October 2022)
- Practice using branches and merging pull requests
- Update README.md using markdown as the project progresses
- 8 different options for each of the message components
